In recent years, artificial intelligence (AI) has gained immense popularity and emerged as a disruptive technology. Its influence can be observed across various domains, including academia and business. Notably, advanced chatbots like ChatGPT have made significant advancements, enabling human-like conversations. This project aims to leverage the power of AI to develop a personalized assistant for APU students. 
The proposed personal assistant will serve a similar purpose to the existing student ambassadors but with notable enhancements. It will provide round-the-clock availability, eliminating any downtime and enabling students to access information related to their university life at any time. Furthermore, the AI will undergo continuous fine-tuning, ensuring future improvements and advancements. This AI-powered assistant will cater to the needs of all students, regardless of their experience or tenure at the university. It will address a wide range of queries, such as but not limited to visa renewal procedures, location of accommodation blocks, and available university facilities. By embracing this cutting-edge technology, our objective is to offer students an exceptional support system that reflects APU's esteemed position as a technological leader.
Implementing this project will position Asia Pacific University as a leader in Malaysia, being among the first universities to adopt such advanced technology. We strongly believe that this initiative will bring significant benefits to the university community, transforming the way students access information and reinforcing APU's commitment to innovation.
